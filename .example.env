# Example Environment Variables for Memory Tools
#
# To use this, you can copy this file to a new file named `.env` and customize the values.
#
# IMPORTANT: Your Go application currently reads from actual environment variables,
# not from a .env file directly. To load a .env file automatically on startup,

# you would need to add a library like 'github.com/joho/godotenv' to your main.go.
#
# Alternatively, you can 'export' these variables in your shell before running the app.
